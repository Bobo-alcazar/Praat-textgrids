  2019-06-27  1.0     r12 declared as 1.0.
  2019-06-30  1.0.1   Bug fix. Vowels lacked 'aeiouyæø'!
  2019-06-30  1.0.2   Further bug fix. Added in-line diacritics to symbols.
  2019-07-01  1.0.3   More verbose docstrings. Removed optional argument from
                      TextGrid.tier_from_csv().
  2019-07-10  1.1.0   When retain_diacritics=True, Transcript.transcode() now
                      works as it should: in Praat notation, over/understrikes
                      follow the symbol, in Unicode, they precede it. This
                      requires some swapping of characters. This also means
                      that besides ‘diacritics’ variable there are also
                      ‘inline_diacritics’ and ‘index_diacritics’.
  2019-07-11  1.1.1   Separated Transcript in a submodule.
  2019-07-14  1.2.0   Read binary textgrids.
  2019-07-15  1.3.0   Simplified text-file parsers and got rid of the optional
                      binary= parameter for TextGrid.parse() and
                      TextGrid.read(). Also new TextGrid.format() and the
                      ability to write files in any of the formats.
